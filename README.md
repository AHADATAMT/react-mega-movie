A site of now-playing and top-rated movies. Up-to-date using [The Movie DB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org)

# Challenge 
* Not easy to have a clear flow at the beginning for a beginner, easy to endup with a mess of small components. 
* Many will-know-in-future tools. Now using very basic tools so get to know that how usefull those in-the-future-tools will be.
* Bootstrap is suck in react. Seems too hard to create a functionality (**Pagination, slider,etc...**) by my own, but the available ones are ugly @.@. Although many packages, libaries are provied but they are inconsistent as a whole.  Reactstrap is still limited. 

## User Stories

* [x] The following **required** functionalities are completed (this is a sample):
* [x] The user can see the top 20 "Currently Playing" movies on a page.
* [x] For each movie, the user can see the Movie Title, Year, Rating, and Poster.
* [x] The user can see this information clearly on devices of various screen sizes.
* [x] The user can see "more" movies by tapping a "See More" button at the bottom.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] The user can enter a term into a search box to filter the currently loaded movies by search term. E.g.; the user can type "mar" and * [ ] the results are reduced to show "Captain Marvel".
* [x] The user can change the "source" from "Currently Playing" movies to "Top Rated" movies (or any other of the endpoints supplied by MovieDB).
* [x] Sort by Rating and Popularity (from Lowest to Highest and Vice Versa)
* [x] Have Year, Rating as a slider. Change the display dynamically when the slider is changed. You could use React Input Range package for this task.

 * [x] Pagination.
 * [ ] Routing

The following **additional** features are implemented:
* [x] Sort by Genres
* [ ] Rolling up & down button

## Time Spent and Lessons Learned
